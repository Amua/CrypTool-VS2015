# CrypTool-VS2015 DEVELOPERS README

This README file is the starting point for all developers interested in contributing to the project.

## Build Requirements

The following is **REQUIRED** to build CrypTool:

- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition**: You can acquire this IDE from Microsoft for free, but make sure you include the "Microsoft Foundation Classes" (MFC) during installation, otherwise you won't be able to build CrypTool.
- **ActivePerl Free Community Edition**: The [ActiveState Perl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl) distribution is recommended, but you should be able to work with any Perl version >= 5.00.

The following is **RECOMMENEDED**, but not required, to work with CrypTool:

- **git**: You can use [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to organize your code and submit pull requests against this repository, but simply downloading a ZIP archive from this site works as well if you're just interested in building CrypTool and not contributing anything.
- **NSIS Installer**: You can use [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/) to build CrypTool setup executables. This is not required, but it makes publishing your work to other people easier.

## Build Instructions

#### Acquire CrypTool Source Code

Run **git clone https://github.com/flomar/CrypTool-VS2015** to check out the source code, and then switch to the branch you want to build. The master branch itself doesn't contain any code, so you have to choose between one of the available branches, for example you can run **git checkout unstable** to check out "unstable" branch.

#### Make Perl Available

Put the Perl distribution you installed (see above) into your **%PATH%** variable.

#### Building CrypTool

Fire up VS2015 and open the CrypTool solution file **trunk/CrypTool/CrypTool-VS2015.sln**. Choose your preferred solution configuration depending on the desired language, for example "Debug_en" or "Release_en". Then build the solution, set "CrypTool" as start-up project, and run it.
