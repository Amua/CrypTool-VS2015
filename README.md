# CrypTool-VS2015

This is a fork of CrypTool to provide support for Visual Studio 2015.

Please visit http://www.cryptool.org for information on the original project.

The code in this repository was forked from r3717 of the CrypTool SVN repository. It was refactored quite heavily to enable students and other interested parties to work with CrypTool using the free-to-use Community Edition of VS2015. Older IDEs like VS2008 or VS2010 are not supported, please refer to the original CrypTool SVN repository for legacy support.

The long-term goal of this project is to refactor all the legacy code so that CrypTool is no longer dependent on a set of deprecated libraries, but instead using a to-be-implemented OpenSSL-based abstraction layer.

This repository contains four main branches: master, stable, unstable, and experimental.

- The **master** branch does not contain any code, it simply contains this README file for the project, a README file for developers, and a license file.
- The **stable** branch contains a stable version of the code, therefore it is empty for now.
- The **unstable** branch contains code which can be compiled, but the runtime behavior in some areas is undefined due to the fact that a lot of temporarily deactivated legacy code has not been refactored yet.
- The **experimental** branch is a constant work in progress, most probably the code in this branch will not compile successfully.

Please take a look at the DEVELOPERS document if you're interested in contributing.
